# Long-Term Crafting Projects (CrafTecs)

This is a mod for the game Project Zomboid that adds long-term, interrupt- and resumable crafting projects, possible to be done by multiple players.

# Project Goal

Providing an in-game mechanism for crafting with the following properties:

- Can be interrupted and resumed as necessary (done)
- CrafTecs can require multiple professions or Traits, requiring players to work together to finish them (done)
- Optional: Players may try a CrafTec without the required skill, but have only a Player.SkillLvl in CrafTec.RequiredSkillLvl chance to succeed, on fail: parts break and need to be re-acquired
